# Password-generator
In this repository we are going to generate a random password using Random library 

# Explaination
First of all create lists of:
. Lowercase alphabet characters
. Uppercase alphabet characters
. Numbers
. Symbols

Then combine them all in "pass_list" and by using random library make a choise of "pass_list" and add it to the "password" string and repeat it by "length" time using a for loop.
Finally show the "password" as result of password generated.

Have fun!
